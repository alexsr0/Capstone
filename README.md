Heatmap.php & Homepagev5.php:
  The bar chart is appended to the svg (id=svgbar) within the div element (id=bardiv)


finaldraft5_m2.js:
  The functionality for the bar chart can be found starting on line 172, within the onclick mouse event. When the user clicks       a country, it generates the bar chart which compares the data for the country with the region and the world. This functionality shows up again on line 371 (this adds the bar chart functionality when a new attribute is selected from the dropdown menu). On both occasions, the code selects and modifies the div with id=#bardiv and it's child svg with id = #svgbar in the homepagev5.php and heatmap.php files, so you may want to modify the div element in those files in terms of style and site layout as well as the .js code itself.
